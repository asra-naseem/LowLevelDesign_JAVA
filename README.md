## 1. Implemented Strategy Pattern

The **Strategy Design Pattern** is a behavioral design pattern that allows a class's behavior or algorithm to be selected at runtime. It encapsulates a family of algorithms into separate classes, making them interchangeable without altering the code that uses them. This promotes **flexibility**, **reusability**, and adherence to the **Open/Closed Principle**.
